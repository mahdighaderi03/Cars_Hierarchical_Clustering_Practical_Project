# Clustring_Hierarchiacal_Cars_Practical_Project
Our goal is to group vehicles based on similarities in a hierarchical manner, determine the most similar group to their prototypes, and identify competing models within that group.

It is obvious that we have 3 main clusters with the majority of vehicles in those.

# Cars:

* Cluster 1: with almost high mpg, and low in horsepower.
* Cluster 2: with good mpg and horsepower, but higher price than average.
* Cluster 3: with low mpg, high horsepower, highest price.

# Trucks:

* Cluster 1: with almost highest mpg among trucks, and lowest in horsepower and price.
* Cluster 2: with almost low mpg and medium horsepower, but higher price than average.
* Cluster 3: with good mpg and horsepower, low price.
